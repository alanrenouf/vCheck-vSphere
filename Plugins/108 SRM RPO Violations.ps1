# vCheck Plug-in: vCenter Site Recovery Manager - RPO Violation Report
#
# This plug-in can be used to generate a custom report of RPO violations found in the vCenter event log. It is heavily
# based on Alan Renouf's work found at: http://www.virtu-al.net/2013/06/14/reporting-on-rpo-violations-from-vsphere-replication/.
#
# The settings are mostly self-explanatory:
#
# $RPOviolationMins     - report on events that indicate an RPO exceeded by x minutes
# $MaxHours             - review vCenter events that are no older than x hours
# $MaxEvents            - the maximum number of vCenter events to review
# $VMNameExpression     - only look for RPO events on VMs with these names
# $ActiveViolationsOnly - report can display all RPO events based on above criteria, or only active unresolved ones
# $EnableEmailReport    - if set to $true, will set vCheck's e-mail reporting to $true if RPO violations found.
#                         this is useful if you run the report regularly, but only want to receive an e-mail when
#                         there is a violation that meets the defined criteria (vCheck e-mail reporting would
#                         need to be set to $false for this to have any effect)
#
# Note, the RPO violation start time is based on the violations found within the configured event search criteria.
# For example, if you are only searching through four hours of events, then the ViolationStart will reflect the
# a start time within that four hour window, though the violation may have actually begun earlier.
#
# Use at your own risk.
#
##
 
# Start of Settings
# Set the number of minutes an RPO has exceeded to report on
$RPOviolationMins = 240
# Set the maximum number of hours to go back and review vCenter events
$MaxHours = 72
# Set the maximum number of vCenter events to retrieve
$MaxEvents = 100000
# Set a VM name filter to report RPO violations on
$VMNameExpression = "*"
# Report on unresolved RPO violations only?
$ActiveViolationsOnly = $true
# Enable vCheck e-mail report?
$EnableEmailReport = $true
# End of Settings
